GetNextLine

get_next_line is an individual project at Epitech that basically reads a file line by line.
There are so many easier methods of doing this by using standard C functions.
But the goal here is to be able to do it by using any functions from my libft and only the standard functions read, malloc and free.

COMPILATION

gcc *.c

USAGE

cat "file" | ./a.out or ./a.out with standard input
